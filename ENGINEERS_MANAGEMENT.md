# Engineers Management Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive Engineers management system to replace hardcoded engineer data with a fully dynamic, database-driven solution.

## New Features Added

### 1. **EngineersPage Component**
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, delete engineers
- **Search & Filter**: Search by name/specialization, filter by specialization
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Total engineers, specializations count, active engineers
- **Specialization Distribution**: Visual breakdown of engineers by specialization
- **Inline Editing**: Edit engineers directly in the table
- **Modal Forms**: Clean modal interface for adding new engineers

### 2. **Enhanced Engineer API**
```typescript
// New API methods added:
engineerApi.update(id, engineer)     // Update engineer details
engineerApi.delete(id)               // Delete engineer
engineerApi.getById(id)              // Get single engineer
```

### 3. **Dynamic Specializations System**
- **Database Table**: `engineer_specializations` for managing specializations
- **API**: `specializationsApi` for specialization management
- **Dynamic Loading**: Specializations loaded from database
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new specializations without code changes

### 4. **Navigation Integration**
- **Sidebar Menu**: Added "المهندسين" (Engineers) menu item
- **Icon**: Uses Wrench icon for engineers section
- **Routing**: Integrated with App.tsx routing system

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `engineer_specializations`
```sql
CREATE TABLE engineer_specializations (
    id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    specialization_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Default Specializations
- مكيفات هواء (Air Conditioning)
- أجهزة التبريد (Refrigeration)
- أجهزة الغسيل (Washing Machines)
- أجهزة المطبخ (Kitchen Appliances)
- صيانة عامة (General Maintenance)
- إلكترونيات (Electronics)
- كهرباء (Electrical)
- ميكانيكا (Mechanical)

## User Interface Features

### Engineers List View
- **Responsive Table**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Status Indicators**: Active/inactive status for engineers
- **Action Buttons**: Edit and delete buttons for each engineer
- **Search Bar**: Real-time search functionality
- **Specialization Filter**: Dropdown filter by specialization

### Add/Edit Engineer Form
- **Name Field**: Engineer's full name
- **Specialization Dropdown**: Select from predefined specializations
- **Custom Specialization**: Option to enter custom specialization
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation
- **Modal Interface**: Clean, focused editing experience

### Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Engineers**: Count of all engineers
- **Specializations Count**: Number of different specializations
- **Active Engineers**: Currently active engineers
- **Average Experience**: Placeholder for future enhancement

### Specialization Distribution
- **Visual Charts**: Bar charts showing engineer distribution
- **Percentage Breakdown**: Shows percentage of engineers per specialization
- **Color-coded**: Different colors for each specialization

## Integration Points

### App.tsx Integration
```typescript
// New state management
const [specializations, setSpecializations] = useState<string[]>([]);

// New handler functions
const handleAddEngineer = async (engineer) => { ... };
const handleUpdateEngineer = async (id, engineer) => { ... };
const handleDeleteEngineer = async (id) => { ... };

// Data loading
specializationsApi.getAll()
```

### Sidebar Navigation
```typescript
// Added to menu items
{ icon: Wrench, label: 'المهندسين', id: 'engineers' }
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **No More Hardcoded Engineers**
- ✅ Engineers are now fully managed through the UI
- ✅ No need to modify code to add/remove engineers
- ✅ Database-driven engineer management

### 2. **Dynamic Specializations**
- ✅ Specializations loaded from database
- ✅ Easy to add new specializations
- ✅ Consistent specialization options across the app

### 3. **Professional Management Interface**
- ✅ Modern, responsive design
- ✅ Intuitive user experience
- ✅ Comprehensive CRUD operations

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Referential integrity with complaints

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Engineer Profiles**
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Certifications and qualifications
- Experience level and years of service
- Performance metrics

### 2. **Workload Management**
- Current assigned complaints count
- Availability status
- Work schedule management
- Performance analytics

### 3. **Specialization Management UI**
- Admin interface for managing specializations
- Add/edit/delete specializations
- Specialization categories and hierarchies

### 4. **Advanced Features**
- Engineer photo uploads
- Skills and competency tracking
- Training records
- Performance reviews

## Usage Instructions

### Adding a New Engineer
1. Navigate to "المهندسين" (Engineers) page
2. Click "إضافة مهندس جديد" (Add New Engineer)
3. Fill in engineer name and select specialization
4. Click "إضافة المهندس" (Add Engineer)

### Editing an Engineer
1. Find the engineer in the list
2. Click the edit (pencil) icon
3. Modify the fields inline
4. Click the save (checkmark) icon

### Deleting an Engineer
1. Find the engineer in the list
2. Click the delete (trash) icon
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

### Searching Engineers
1. Use the search bar to find engineers by name or specialization
2. Use the specialization filter dropdown to filter by specific specialization

This implementation provides a complete, professional engineer management system that eliminates all hardcoded engineer data and provides a scalable foundation for future enhancements.
